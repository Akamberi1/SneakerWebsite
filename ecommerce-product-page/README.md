## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

<!-- - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size -->
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

<!-- ### Screenshots

-You can find the screenshots of the project on the screenshots folder. -->

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS styling (Flexbox, Pseudo-elements, etc.)
- JavaScript
<!-- - Responsive Web Design -->

### What I learned

 HTML:

-Learned how object and svg elements work.

 CSS:

-Learned different variantions of hover, focus, placeholder, selections effects.

-Learned how do to deal with borders.

-Learned how outline and cursor properties work.

-Learned how text decoration - underline properties work.

-Learned how the pointer event, visibility, and opacity properties work.

-Learned how the stroke property of graphical elements work.

-Learned how to make the website blurry with backdrop filters (overlay class in CSS file);

-Learned that you can hover multiple classes.

-Learned how to apply different fonts for different parts of the project.


 JS:

-Learned some new ways of DOM manipulation.

-Learned more about the 'addEventListener' method and the "removeEventListener" method.

-Learned how i can manipulate when a part of project shows and when it hides, manipulating the display and opacity property in CSS.

-Learned how i can transfer some data to the textContent of an element.

-Learned how to make an complex Carousel with items which you can click on and the image will shift to the one that is being clicked.

-Learned how do i change the styling so when i click on an item the styling will change(in this case the border and opacity will change), making it like it is connected with the big item that is being shown, so whenever you change the item that is clicked the styling will also be changed.

-Learned how do i make a second carousel with the original one being connected to so when click an item the big image of the item will appear. However, when you click the big image it will show another carousel(different from the previous one), which will continue to the image where the first carousel was holding.

-Learned how i can also add the "next" and "previous" buttons for the carousel so you can go back or further from the current item that is clicked.

-Learned how do i increase or decrease the number of shoes i will buy.

-Learned so when i click the "Add to Cart" button the number of shoes i want to buy first is displayed in the little cart above(like an notification popup) that tells you how much you have in your cart, and then when you click it you can actually see the product that you are buying, and the popup will go away.(When you add the item to the cart, the "add to cart" button, the increase and decrease button will stop working until you delete the product in the cart, because it is only 1 item that i have displayed on the website).

-Learned how i can change the content of the little cart based of if im buying any shoes or not , so if my number is 0 then nothing will be displayed. However, if i'm buying a pair or more then based on the number of pairs the price will also change.

-Learned how to make it so when i click the popup notification, even if i click the button again with the same number of shoes the popup wont appear becuase the desired product is already there.

-Learned how to remove the product that was added to the cart using the delete icon that i added, which will automatically make the increase, decrease, and the "add to cart" button function again.

Note: when you first render the page and you dont buy anything the cart will always be empty (for clarification);

### Continued development

After completing this challenge, I can say i still have yet to learn more about these languages, because everyday new things get added to these languages, so i will try to be more up-to-date with these.

HTML:

- I want to learn more about semantic HTML tags, because there are still many more HTML tags getting added everyday to make this language even more flexible and fun.

CSS:

- I Want to learn more about pseudo elements, the maximum use of the hover effect, and also so many much more properties that i have still yet to discover .

JS:

- I want to learn even more about high-quality carousels, the maximum use of DOM manipulation and other ways i can make the website more interactive;
